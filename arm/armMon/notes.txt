Just keeping some notes here

TODO: 
	implement full logic
	check interval/list preprocessor switches
	implement hard conservative?

artificial trace data ---
	We have 3 "dimensions"
		conservative/aggressive
		interval/lists
		restricted/full logic


Traces we need to run:
	single temporal with increasing duration

	nesting with increasing depth (across durations?)

	Full vs restricted logic
		same formula -- should have same results
		formulas that are better for full
			across durations!
		any that are worse for full?

	aggressive vs conservative
		overall computation
		time to eval
		best vs worst case
