	time-sensitive systems, where violation of timing constraints are
	undesired. Our goal is to describe the challenges in instrumenting,
	measuring, and monitoring such systems and present our solutions
	developed in the past few years to deal with these challenges. The
	tutorial consists of two parts. First, we present challenge problems
	and corresponding solutions on instrumenting real-time systems so
	that timing constraints of the system are respected. The second part
	of the tutorial will focus on time-triggered runtime monitoring,
	where a monitor is invoked at equal time intervals, allowing designers
	to schedule regular and monitoring tasks hand-in-hand.},

  abstract = {The ISO 26262 Road vehicles Functional Safety Standard is intended
	to guide the derivation of appropriate requirements and processes
	for avoiding systematic and/or random failures in automotive electrical/electronic
	equipment. Functional safety statements can be captured in the requirements
	specifications for automotive embedded control units and systems.
	However, the process of verifying the behaviour of resulting products
	continues to be incomplete; because embedded programme verification
	is unsolvable in general. This study shows that it is possible to
	monitor some proof obligations in the testing phase, or even in the
	actual operating phase of a system by the use of an on-chip, real-time
	runtime verification monitor. In this work, the ISO 26262 standard
	for functional safety is used to guide the definition of the functional
	safety requirements for a product, and the specific requirements
	are mapped to logic formulae, such that the actual runtime behaviour
	of the system for selected properties can be formally verified throughout
	the lifetime of a product. A case study example for an automotive
	gearbox control system is presented to demonstrate the feasibility
	of the scheme. The monitor is constructed as a permanent feature
	within an integrated circuit that can continuously observe the system's
	runtime behaviour.},
