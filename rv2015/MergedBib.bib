	from tests, where tests take the form of vectors of inputs (supplied
	to the system) and outputs (produced by the system in response to
	inputs). The approach uses data-mining techniques to infer invariants
	from the test data, and an automated-verification technology to determine
	which of these proposed invariants are indeed invariant and may thus
	be seen as requirements. Experimental results from a pilot study
	involving an automotive-electronics application show that using tests
	that fully cover the structure of the software yield more complete
	invariants than structurally-agnostic black-box tests.},

	quantitative temporal operators. The formulas of the resulting logic,
	TCTL, are interpretation over continuous computation trees, trees
	in which paths are maps from the set of nonnegative reals to system
	states. To model finite-state systems the notion of timed graphs
	is introduced-state-transition graphs extended with a mechanism that
	allows the expression of constant bounds on the delays between the
	state transition. As the main result, an algorithm is developed for
	model checking, that is, for determining the truth of a TCTL formula
	with respect to a timed graph. It is argued that choosing a dense
	domain, instead of a discrete domain, to model time does not blow
	up the complexity of the model-checking problem. On the negative
	side, it is shown that the denseness of the underlying time domain
	makes TCTL II11-hard. The question of deciding whether a given TCTL
	formula is implementable by a timed graph is also undecidable},

	move back and forth while reading a timed word. Two-wayness in its
	unrestricted form leads, like nondeterminism, to the undecidability
	of language inclusion. However, if they restrict the number of times
	an input symbol may be revisited, then two-wayness is both harmless
	and desirable. The authors show that the resulting class of bounded
	two-way deterministic timed automata is closed under all boolean
	operations, has decidable (PSPACE-complete) emptiness and inclusion
	problems, and subsumes all decidable real-time logics we know. They
	obtain a strict hierarchy of real-time properties: deterministic
	timed automata can accept more languages as the bound on the number
	of times an input symbol may be revisited is increased. This hierarchy
	is also enforced by the number of alternations between past and future
	operators in temporal logic. The combination of the results leads
	to a decision procedure for a real-time logic with past operators},

	Formal verification is achieved through the automation of semi-formal
	(rigorous) proofs using a theorem prover (Proofpower HOL). To illustrate
	the approach, we use the Railroad Crossing Problem, which has been
	proposed, along with a set of criteria for assessment, as a benchmark

	analysis of system requirements, ESC-QC specifications can be translated
	into monitors and used for run-time verification of designs. In automotive
	systems Simulink/Stateflow (SL/SF) is widely used for design of control
	systems. We have developed an algorithm for automatic synthesis of

  abstract = {For designing modern automation systems (event-driven complex reactive
	systems which continuously react to external stimuli) it is necessary
	to define guidelines, methods and tools that allow to carry out the
	designs within an overall development methodology that permits to
	specify these systems in an easy and safe way, to maintain traceability
	along the different phases of the design, and to have the needed
	knowledge about the behaviors of the defined system. Basic issues
	related to current specification technology have been discussed in
	the companion paper. The current paper describes the present status
	of our work in validating this methodology on the control of an elevator
	system. An elevator system is usually equipped with a fairly large
	number of sensors, making it a real-scale application, but simple
	enough to serve in demonstrating the basic principles involved with
	clarity. Entire system is designed using state charts and implemented
	in a programmable logic device. To demonstrate the feasibility a
	prototype system is simulated using micro controllers and the results
	are presented in the paper. However, in this implementation, statecharts
	are only used as formal specification of control which provides the
	basis for functional decomposition of the program into communicating
	finite state machines (FSM): port structures proposed in (S. Devapriya
	Dewasurendra, 2006) for reconfigurable implementation are not yet
	incorporated. Hence, the current paper discusses primary issues of
	modular controller implementation using statechart specifications.
	Verification has been done by simulating the controller on PIC 16F877
	MC in Proteous 6 for selected operations. Formal verification methodology
	of the previous work will be validated in the next stage of this
	research},

  abstract = { The increasing gap between design complexity and compute power for
	verification necessitates radically new solutions to meet the verification
	challenges for future generations of hardware designs. Increasingly
	it will not be possible to completely validate hardware prior to
	fabrication. We will need to reconcile ourselves to the fact that
	hardware, like software, will be shipped with bugs. However, this
	can be acceptable with appropriate mechanisms for runtime validation
	that detect bugs and recover from them when needed. This paper takes
	a significant step in examining runtime validation as part of the
	verification methodology. It examines the strengths and weaknesses
	of runtime validation and how it may be used to complement model
	checking in a hybrid methodology. We consider the use of on-chip
	hardware for detecting bugs using hardware assertions. These assertions
	may be used for validating abstractions and assumptions for use in
	offline model checking. Hardware based assertions monitor properties
	at runtime and do not suffer from the state explosion problem. Offline
	model checking is used to validate globally distributed properties
	where runtime error detection has limitations in monitoring and responding
	to signals separated by many clock cycles. In this case the hardware
	based runtime validated abstractions and assumptions help in reducing
	the state space for model checking. Our ideas are demonstrated on
	a highly concurrent, yet simple to understand token sharing protocol,
	as well as a fairly complex cache coherence system.},

	of the multi-dimensional, multi-attribute nature of dependability
	claims; of the difficult role played by dependence between different

	the appropriate test input provided to the implementation under test
	(IUT) is separated as much as possible from the analysis of the observed
	output. Particular emphasis is placed on the analysis of the observed
	interactions of the IUT in order to determine whether the observed
	input/output trace conforms to the IUT's specification. The authors
	consider this aspect of testing with particular attention to testing
	of communication protocol implementations. Various distributed test
	architectures are used for this purpose, where partial input/output
	traces are observable by local observers at different interfaces.
	The error-detection power of different test configurations is determined
	on the basis of the partial trace visible to each local observer
	and their global knowledge about the applied test case. The automated
	construction of trace analysis modules from the formal specification
	of the protocol is also discussed. Different transformations of the
	protocol specification may be necessary to obtain the reference specification,
	which can be used by a local or global observer for checking the
	observed trace. Experience with the construction of an arbiter for
	the OSI (open systems interconnection) transport protocol is described},

  abstract = {Runtime monitoring aims at analyzing the well-being of a system at
	run time in order to detect errors and steer the system towards a
	healthy behavior. Such monitoring is a complementary technique to
	other approaches for ensuring correctness, such as formal verification
	and testing. In time-triggered runtime monitoring, a monitor runs
	as a separate process in parallel with an application program under
	scrutiny and samples the program's state periodically to evaluate
	a set of properties. Applying this technique in a computing system
	results in obtaining bounded and predictable overhead. Gaining such
	characteristics for overhead is highly desirable for designing and
	engineering time-critical applications, such as safety-critical embedded
	systems. However, a time-triggered monitor requires certain synchronization
	features at operating system level and may suffer from various concurrency
	and synchronization dependencies and overheads as well as possible
	unreliability of synchronization primitives in a real-time setting.
	In this paper, we propose a new method, where the program under inspection
	is instrumented, so that it self-samples its state in a periodic
	fashion without requiring assistance from an external monitor or
	internal timer. We call this technique time-triggered self-monitoring.
	First, we formulate an optimization problem for minimizing the number
	of points in a program, where self-sampling instrumentation instructions
	must be inserted. We show that this problem is NP-complete. Consequently,
	we propose a SAT-based solution and a heuristic to cope with the
	exponential complexity. Our experimental results show that a time-triggered
	self-monitored program performs significantly better than the same
	program monitored by an external time-triggered monitor.},

	to specification becomes an increasingly important but also hard
	problem. Current practice based on ad-hoc testing does not provide
	correctness guarantees, while highly confident traditional formal
	methods like model checking and theorem proving are still too expensive
	to become common practice. In this paper we present a paradigm for
	combining formal specification with implementation, called monitoring-oriented
	programming (MoP), providing a light-weighted formal method to check
	conformance of implementation to specification at runtime. System
	requirements are expressed using formal specifications given as annotations
	inserted at various user selected places in programs. Efficient monitoring
	code using the same target language as the implementation is then
	automatically generated during a pre-compilation stage. The generated
	code has the same effect as a logical checking of requirements and

  abstract = {Requirements analysis includes a preliminary acquisition step where
	a global model for the specification of the system and its environment
	is elaborated. This model, called requirements model, involves concepts
	that are currently not supported by existing formal specification
	languages, such as goals to be achieved, agents to be assigned, alternatives
	to be negotiated, etc. The paper presents an approach to requirements
	acquisition which is driven by such higher-level concepts. Requirements
	models are acquired as instances of a conceptual meta-model. The
	latter can be represented as a graph where each node captures an
	abstraction such as, e.g., goal, action, agent, entity, or event,
	and where the edges capture semantic links between such abstractions.
	Well-formedness properties on nodes and links constrain their instances
	-- that is, elements of requirements models. Requirements acquisition
	processes then correspond to particular ways of traversing the meta-model
	graph to acquire appropriate instances of the various nodes and links
	according to such constraints. Acquisition processes are governed
	by strategies telling which way to follow systematically in that
	graph; at each node specific tactics can be used to acquire the corresponding
	instances. The paper describes a significant portion of the meta-model
	related to system goals, and one particular acquisition strategy
	where the meta-model is traversed backwards from such goals. The
	meta-model and the strategy are illustrated by excerpts of a university
	library system.},

	Monitoring allows one to analyze and recover from detected faults,

	interest in its application to fault detection and recovery, largely

	systems. We present taxonomy that developers and researchers can
	use to analyze and differentiate recent developments in runtime software
	fault-monitoring approaches. The taxonomy categorizes the various
	runtime monitoring research by classifying the elements that are
	considered essential for building a monitoring system, i.e., the
	specification language used to define properties; the monitoring
	mechanism that oversees the program's execution; and the event handler
	that captures and communicates monitoring results. After describing

	for testing and as a component of execution-based model checking
	techniques. Traditional run-time monitoring however, is limited to
	observing sequences of pure Boolean propositions. This paper describes
	tools for observing temporal properties over time series, namely,
	sequences of propositions with constraints on data value changes
	over time. Using such Temporal Logic with time Series (TLS), it is
	possible to monitor important properties such as stability, monotonicity,
	temporal average and sum values, and temporal min/max values. The
	specification and monitoring of linear time temporal logic with real-time
	and time series constraints are supported by the Temporal Rover and
	the DBRover, which are in-process and remote run-time monitoring
	tools. The novel TLS extension described in this paper is based on
	practical experience and feedback provided by NASA engineers after
	using the DBRover to verify flight code. The paper also presents
	a novel hybrid approach to verify timing properties in rapid system
	prototyping that combines the traditional schedulability analysis
	of the design and the monitoring of timing constraint satisfaction
	during prototype execution based on a time-series temporal logic.
	The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated with a prototype
	of the fish farm control system software.},

  title = {A Framework for Dynamic Safety and Risk Management Modeling in Complex
	Engineering Systems},
  school = {MIT},
  year = {2007},
  month = {February},
  __markedentry = {[akane:]},
  abstract = {Almost all traditional hazard analysis or risk assessment techniques,
	such as failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA), fault tree analysis
	(FTA), and probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) rely on a chain-of-event
	paradigm of accident causation. Event-based techniques have some
	limitations for the study of modem engineering systems. Specifically,
	they are not suited to handle complex software-intensive systems,
	complex human-machine interactions, and systems-of-systems with distributed
	decision-making that cut across both physical and organizational
	boundaries. STAMP (System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes)
	is a comprehensive accident model created by Nancy Leveson that is
	based on systems theory. It draws on concepts from engineering, mathematics,
	cognitive and social psychology, organizational theory, political
	science, and economics. The general notion in STAMP is that accidents
	result from inadequate enforcement of safety constraints in design,
	development, and operation. STAMP includes traditional failure-based
	models as a subset, but goes beyond physical failures to include
	causal factors involving dysfunctional interactions among non-failing
	components; software and logic design errors; errors in complex human
	decision-making; various organizational characteristics such as workforce,
	safety processes and standards, contracting; and other managerial,
	social, organizational, and cultural factors. The main contribution
	of this thesis is the augmentation of STAMP with a dynamic executable
	modeling framework in order to further improve safety in the development
	and operation of complex engineering systems. This executable modeling
	framework: 1) enables the dynamic analysis of safety-related decision-making
	in complex systems, 2) assists with the design and testing of non-intuitive
	policies and processes to better mitigate risks and prevent time-dependent
	risk increase, and 3) enables the identification of technical and
	organizational factors to detect and monitor states of increasing
	risk before an accident occurs. The modeling framework is created
	by combining STAMP safety control structures with system dynamic
	modeling principles. A component-based model-building methodology
	is proposed to facilitate the building of customized STAMP-based
	dynamic risk management models and make them accessible to managers
	and engineers with limited simulation experience. A library of generic
	executable components is provided as a basis for model creation,
	refinement, and validation. A toolset is assembled to identify risk
	increase patterns, analyze time-dependent risks, assist engineers
	and managers in safety-related decision-making, create and test risk
	mitigation actions and policies, and monitor the system for states
	of increasing risk. The usefulness of the new framework is demonstrated
	in two independent projects: 1) A risk analysis of the NASA Independent
	Technical Authority (ITA), an organization mandated by the Columbia
	Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) to provide independent safety
	oversight of space shuttle operations, and 2) A risk management study
	for the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) at NASA. For
	these two projects, model refinement, validation and analysis required
	extensive data collection and interactions with NASA workforce. Over
	45 interviews were conducted at five NASA centers (HQ, MSFC, KSC,
	JSC, and LaRC). Interviewees included representatives from the Office
	of the Administrator, the Office of the Chief Engineer, the Office
	of Safety and Mission Assurance, ESMD Directorate Offices, Program/Project
	Offices, and many others. Among other data sources, 200 pages of
	interview transcripts were compiled and used for model creation and
	validation activities. Specific risks analyzed include: 1) NASA workforce
	and knowledge management issues, 2) the impact of various levels
	of outsourcing, 3) the impact of safety priority on design, and 4)
	the impact of requirements change on safety and schedule during development.},

	running system is meeting its requirements. Monitoring is a commonly
	applied technique in support of performance tuning, but the focus
	therein is primarily on computational performance requirements in
	short runs of systems. We wish to address systems that operate in
	a long lived, ongoing fashion in nonscientific enterprise applications.
	We argue that the results of requirements monitoring can be of benefit
	to the designers, maintainers and users of a system-alerting them
	when the system is being used in an environment for which it was
	not designed, and giving them the information they need to direct
	their redesign of the system. Studies of two commercial systems are
	used to illustrate and justify our claims.},

	facilitates the building of the fault tree. The common cause failure
	(CCF) analysis is a very important aspect that must be considered

  abstract = {The benefits of using Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in maritime
	operations are numerous. However, before these benefits can be realized,
	UUV capabilities must be expanded. This thesis focuses on improving
	certain aspects of the Maritime Reconnaissance and Undersea Search
	and Survey capabilities of a UUV. An algorithm is first presented
	which provides the UUV with the ability to estimate the intent of
	the contacts it is observing (intent estimation). This was accomplished
	by developing a probabilistic model of the contact's possible intents
	and then using those models to estimate the contact's actual intent.
	The results from that algorithm are used to analyze the contact's
	observed path to determine a probabilistic belief of the potential
	location of obstacles in the environment (obstacle detection) that
	the contact is avoiding. These values are recorded in an obstacle
	inference map, which is capable of incorporating the results from
	the analysis of any number of observed paths from multiple contacts.
	The laws of probability were used to develop the algorithms in this
	thesis-with an emphasis on Bayes' rule. Various scenarios are presented
	to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of the intent estimation
	and obstacle detection algorithms.},

	involved. In recent correspondence with the authors, Dr Nancy Leveson

	'until recently, system safety was always part of the system engineering
	group. Over time and with ignorance, this interaction has faded.'
	The paper uses empirical and analytical evidence to show that common
	practice - encouraged by process and regulatory standards in some
	industry sectors - has led to system safety assessments that are
	based on far too narrow a view that safety is fundamentally about
	system reliability. The paper shows that good systems engineering
	practice can help overcome the major deficiencies and provide a much
	better basis for safety engineering in the future.},

	for extended periods of time in changing environments, likely in
	remote locations. Software is usually an essential part of such systems.
	However, adaptation of autonomy software is limited by its complexity
	and the difficulty of verifying and validating it. We describe an
	approach named runtime verification for testing autonomy software.
	Runtime verification is a technique for generating test oracles from
	abstract specifications of expected behavior. We describe its application
	to the PLASMA planning system, used in the recent Mars exploration
	rover missions. We furthermore discuss alternative autonomy V V approaches.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an approach for real-time modelling in UML, focusing
	on analysis and verification of time and scheduling-related properties.
	To this aim, a concrete UML profile, called the Omega-RT profile,
	is defined, dedicated to real-time modelling by identifying a set
	of relevant concepts for real-time modelling which can be considered
	as a refinement of the standard SPT profile. The profile is based
	on a rich concept of event representing an instant of state change,
	and allows the expression of duration constraints between occurrences
	of events. These constraints can be provided in the form of OCL-like
	expressions annotating the specification or by means of state machines,
	stereotyped as `observers'. A framework for modelling scheduling
	issues is obtained by adding a notion of resource and a notion of
	execution time. For proving the relevance of these choices, the profile
	has been implemented in a validation tool and applied to case studies.
	It has a formal semantics and is sufficiently general and expressive
	to define a semantic underpinning for other real-time profiles of
	UML which in general define more restricted frameworks. In particular,
	most existing profiles handling real-time issues define a number
	of predefined attributes representing particular durations or constraints
	on them and their semantic interpretation can be expressed in the
	Omega-RT profile.},

	how probable is a system failure) are very important. For both aspects
	methods and tools are available. However, until now for each aspect
	new and independent models must be built for analysis. This paper
	proposes the SAML framework as a formal foundation for both qualitative

	of SAML is the combination of qualitative and quantitative formal
	semantics which allows different analyses on the same model. This
	increases the confidence in the analysis results, simplifies modeling
	and is less error-prone. The SAML framework is tool-independent.
	As proof-of-concept, we present sound transformation of the formalism
	into two state of the art model-checking notations. Prototypical
	tool support for the sound transformation of SAML into PRISM and
	MRMC for probabilistic analysis as well as different variants of

  abstract = {The ISO 26262 Road vehicles Functional Safety Standard is intended
	to guide the derivation of appropriate requirements and processes
	for avoiding systematic and/or random failures in automotive electrical/electronic
	equipment. Functional safety statements can be captured in the requirements
	specifications for automotive embedded control units and systems.
	However, the process of verifying the behaviour of resulting products
	continues to be incomplete; because embedded programme verification
	is unsolvable in general. This study shows that it is possible to
	monitor some proof obligations in the testing phase, or even in the
	actual operating phase of a system by the use of an on-chip, real-time
	runtime verification monitor. In this work, the ISO 26262 standard
	for functional safety is used to guide the definition of the functional
	safety requirements for a product, and the specific requirements
	are mapped to logic formulae, such that the actual runtime behaviour
	of the system for selected properties can be formally verified throughout
	the lifetime of a product. A case study example for an automotive
	gearbox control system is presented to demonstrate the feasibility
	of the scheme. The monitor is constructed as a permanent feature
	within an integrated circuit that can continuously observe the system's
	runtime behaviour.},

	They have stringent timing requirements that have to be adhered to.
	Functional timing requirements need to interact properly with performance
	timing requirements. A novel runtime monitor that can check for proper
	timing behaviour of software, in the actual implementation environment,
	is presented. The monitor can be synthesised from the software-s
	timing requirements specification and instantiated in the programmable
	digital logic of a system on chip (SoC)-based device. Since the monitor
	is synthesised from the program-s requirements, new monitors can
	be automatically generated for new programs. Since the SoC-based
	monitor is deeply embedded, it can operate at the full processor
	speed and will have access to the internal registers of the processing
	system. A low gate count, non-invasive monitor is achievable. A case
	study example, based on a design for an electronic automotive gear
	controller system, is presented. The study shows that the monitor
	is capable of detecting program timing violations, in the implementation
	environment, even though the software design had been properly verified
	against stated requirements. The monitor scheme can be used as a
	supplementary test solution or the monitor can be built into a product
	for lifetime monitoring of timing behaviour, so as to enhance the
	product-s reliability.},

	Methods for Developing High Assurance Systems. The consensus of the
	group was that formal methods are mature enough to be applied in
	software development. The methods have proven their worth in numerous
	industrial projects, and there is little doubt that they have an
	important place in the software development process. Transferring
	formal methods technology to industry is largely a non-technical
	problem (it is often a culture clash) and the transfer is happening
	(slowly). The group agreed that there have been few major breakthroughs
	in formal methods usage since WIFT'95. The one notable exception
	is the increased use of model checking technology in microprocessor
	design. In the hardware community, the use of formal methods has
	moved into the rapid adoption stage, and some formal analysis tools
	have become part of the standard practice. The use of formal methods
	in software engineering is currently limited to the early adopters.
	The challenge for the software community for the next few years is
	to follow the lead of the hardware community by successfully transferring
	formal methods technology into the development of high-assurance

	while manual verification is time-consuming and error-prone, developing
	an oracle to automatically verify test executions can be as costly
	as implementing the original program. This is especially true for
	concurrent programs, due to their non-determinism and complexity.
	In this paper, we present a method that uses partial specifications
	to systematically derive oracles for concurrent programs. We illustrate
	the method by deriving an Ada task that monitors the execution of
	a concurrent Ada program and describe a prototype tool that partially
	automates the derivation process. We present the results of a study
	that shows the derived oracles are surprisingly effective at error
	detection. The study also shows that manual verification is an inaccurate
	means of failure detection, that large test case sets must be used
	to ensure adequate testing coverage, and that test cases must be
	run many times to cover for variations in run-time behaviour},

	we integrate runtime verification module (i.e. Monitor) with program
	itself and minimize overhead of runtime verification too. Our proposed
	method, RVERL, consists of three phases. First, safety properties
	are extracted from program requirements specification. Second, properties
	are mapped to timing, functional and deadline aspects which constitute
	the monitor. Then it is weaved to the program source code. Third,
	at the execution time, the monitor as a wrapper observes program
	behavior and protects the program against its misbehavior (i.e.,
	property violations). Experiments on rail road crossing problem show
	that the RVERL reveals all property violations while overhead of
	runtime verification is just about 4 percent.},

	Since safety analysis requires knowledge of the component faults

	system fault behavior into the nominal system model. Fault behaviors
	typically tend to be quite varied and complex, and incorporating
	them directly into the nominal system model can clutter it severely.
	This manual process is error-prone and also makes model evolution
	difficult. These issues can be resolved by separating the fault behavior
	from the nominal system model in the form of a "fault model", and
	providing a mechanism for automatically combining the two for analysis.
	Towards implementing this approach we identify key requirements for
	a flexible behavioral fault modeling notation. We formalize it as
	a domain-specific language based on Lustre, a textual synchronous
	dataflow language. The fault modeling extensions are designed to
	be amenable for automatic composition into the nominal system model.},

	based on an informal system model, it is unlikely that they will
	be complete, consistent, and error free. In fact, the lack of precise
	models of the system architecture and its failure modes often forces
	the safety analysts to devote much of their effort to finding undocumented
	details of the system behavior and embedding this information in
	the safety artifacts such as the fault trees. In this paper we propose
	an approach, Model-Based Safety Analysis, in which the system and
	safety engineers use the same system models created during a model-based
	development process. By extending the system model with a fault model
	as well as relevant portions of the physical system to be controlled,
	automated support can be provided for much of the safety analysis.
	We believe that by using a common model for both system and safety
	engineering and automating parts of the safety analysis, we can both
	reduce the cost and improve the quality of the safety analysis. Here
	we present our vision of model-based safety analysis and discuss

  __markedentry = {[akane:]},
  abstract = {In Europe, over recent years, there has been a marked shift in the
	regulatory approach to ensuring system safety. Whereas compliance
	with prescriptive safety codes and standards was previously the norm,
	the responsibility has now shifted back onto the developers and operators
	to construct and present well reasoned arguments that their systems
	achieve acceptable levels of safety. These arguments (together with
	supporting evidence) are typically referred to as a "safety case".
	This paper describes the role and purpose of a safety case (as defined
	by current safety and regulatory standards). Safety arguments within
	safety cases are often poorly communicated. This paper presents a
	technique called GSN (Goal Structuring Notation) that is increasingly
	being used in safety-critical industries to improve the structure,
	rigor, and clarity of safety arguments. Based upon the GSN approach,
	the paper also describes how an evolutionary and systematic approach
	to safety case construction, in step with system development, can
	be facilitated.},

  title = {Arguing Safety -- A Systematic Approach to Managing Safety Cases
	},
  school = {University of York},
  year = {1998},
  abstract = {A safety case should present a clear, comprehensive and defensible
	argument that a system is acceptably safe to operate within a particular
	context. However, many existing safety cases, in their attempt to
	manage potentially complex arguments, are poorly structured, presented
	and understood. This creates problems in developing and maintaining
	safety cases, and in capturing successful safety arguments for use
	on future projects. This thesis defines and demonstrates a coherent
	approach to the development, presentation, maintenance and reuse
	of the safety arguments within a safety case. This approach is based
	upon a graphical technique -- the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN)
	-- and has three strands. Firstly, a method for the use of GSN is
	defined together with an approach to supporting incremental safety
	case development. Secondly, the thesis presents a systematic process
	for the maintenance of a GSN-structured safety argument. Thirdly,
	the concept of `Safety Case Patterns' is defined as a means of supporting
	and promoting the reuse of successful safety arguments between safety
	cases. Examples of the approach are provided throughout. Evaluation
	of the approach is described through tool implementation, case studies,
	pilot projects and industrial project applications. Through these
	activities the approach has been shown to be both a valid and capable
	tool for safety case management.},

	in PAMELA, a rule-based expert system language suitable for real-time

  abstract = {In this paper we present a new framework for runtime verification
	of properties of real time systems such as financial systems or backend
	databases. Such a systems has a semantics which resemples that of
	timed traces, namely a sequence of states where each state consists
	of predicates true in this state and then a timestamp explaining
	when the state is valid. We present a logic, LTLt, which is an extension
	of LTL with time constraints and a freeze quantifier and show how
	formulae in this logic are able to express properties of bounded
	liveness and safety which are ideal for these systems. It is shown
	how a formula in LTLt may be rewritten to a certain disjunctive normal
	form suitable for checking a real time system at runtime. The normal
	form captures the essential part of runtime verification by a set
	of mutually defined formula identifiers, each expressing two things:
	What should hold now and which formula identifiers that will need
	to hold in the next state. As part of the theoretical foundation
	for this work we propose a characterization of Runtime Verification
	and address the challenges in developing a method which is both sound
	and complete while at the same time efficient.},

	protection system responses evaluated at the point of common

	rely mainly on vehicle kinematics and dynamics. The contention of
	this paper is that contextual information in the form of topological
	and geometrical characteristics of the intersection can provide useful
	cues to understand the behaviour of a vehicle. We describe a probabilistic
	framework that extracts information from a digital map and uses it
	along with vehicle state information to estimate a driver's intended
	manoeuvre. The proposed approach is applicable to different types
	of intersections and handles uncertainty on the input information.
	We evaluate the performance of our approach on several real life

	be encountered on the job. Simulation-based electrical safety training
	goes beyond teaching concepts and definitions by providing a virtual
	environment for interaction, practice, and immediate application
	of information. In this way it reinforces roles and attitudes, contextualizes
	information, and serves as a content- rich foundation for a safety
	culture. This type of training has been used for decades by high-efficiency
	organizations because they understand that only a fraction of learning
	effectiveness comes from completing lower-level tasks, such as recalling
	terminology and procedures. The complex application of concepts is
	achieved through personalized experiences and unconstrained decision-making
	with realistic consequences. Safety training is an important bottom
	line for any safety culture, and simulation-based electrical safety
	training offers trainees a robust, personalized experience that engages
	and empowers them far beyond the classroom.},

	domain, car manufacturers and tier-one suppliers are gradually introducing
	multicore ECUs in their electronic architectures. Additionally, these
	multicore ECUs offer new features such as higher levels of parallelism
	which ease the respect of the safety requirements such as the ISO
	26262 and the implementation of other automotive use-cases. These
	new features involve also more complexity in the design, development
	and verification of the software applications. Hence, OEMs and suppliers
	will require new tools and methodologies for deployment and validation.
	In this paper, we review the operating system protection mechanisms
	(e.g., memory, timing), needed for multi-source software in a safety
	critical context, with a clear focus on AUTOSAR OS which is the upcoming
	defacto standard for automotive ECUs. Then, we identify the main
	use-cases for automotive multicore ECUs and present solutions for
	the scheduling in a context where there are hundreds of software
	components and only a few OS tasks are allowed. Finally, experiments
	aim to assess the load level that can be reached on realistic case-studies.},

	fault ride through curves are used in the wind industry. Some have
	some very unusual-looking trip characteristics that are polygonal
	in shape, rather than the characteristic rectangular trip curves
	customarily used by protection engineers. This paper will examine
	some of these trip characteristics, increasingly common in the wind
	turbine industry, and show how a rectangular characteristic can be
	used to satisfy a polygonal trip requirement. The use of common trip
	curves such as that proposed by NERC in PRC-024-1 may require some
	changes in generator plant design, as occurred in the wind industry,
	to insure that equipment is designed for low-voltage operation.},

	of software-intensive, safety-critical systems to provide an explicit
	software safety case - a structured set of arguments based on objective
	evidence to demonstrate that the software elements of a system are
	acceptably safe. Existing research on safety cases has mainly focused
	on how to build the arguments in a safety case based on available
	evidence; but little has been done to precisely characterize what
	this evidence should be. As a result, system suppliers are left with
	practically no guidance on what evidence to collect during software
	development. This has led to the suppliers having to recover the
	relevant evidence after the fact - an extremely costly and sometimes
	impractical task. Although standards such as the IEC 61508 - which
	is widely viewed as the best available generic standard for managing
	functional safety in software - provide some guidance for the collection
	of relevant safety and certification information, this guidance is
	mostly textual, not expressed in a precise and structured form, and
	is not easy to specialize to context-specific needs. To address these
	issues, we present a conceptual model to characterize the evidence
	for arguing about software safety. Our model captures both the information
	requirements for demonstrating compliance with IEC 61508 and the
	traceability links necessary to create a seamless chain of evidence.
	We further describe how our generic model can be specialized according
	to the needs of a particular context, and discuss some important
	ways in which our model can facilitate software certification.},

	on a "baseline" flight computer (FC) while research CLs are typically
	housed on a dedicated research computer. Therefore, for an experimental
	aircraft used to test specific fault tolerant flight control systems,
	a safety logic scheme is needed to ensure a safe transition from
	conventional to research CLs (while at nominal conditions) as well
	as from research CLs at nominal conditions to conditions with "simulated"
	failures on specific control surfaces. This paper describes the design
	of such a safety scheme for the NASA Intelligent Flight Control System
	(IFCS) F-15 Program. The goals of the IFCS F-15 program are to investigate
	the performance of a set of fault tolerant CLs based on the use of
	dynamic inversion with neural augmentation. The different transitions
	are monitored using information relative to flight conditions and
	controller-related performance criteria. The testing of the scheme
	is performed with a Simulink-based flight simulation code and interface
	developed at West Virginia University for the NASA IFCS F-15 aircraft.},

	In the absence of secure mechanisms, malicious parties could inject
	bogus information, at best robbing VANETs of their safety benefits
	or at worst causing accidents. Unfortunately, VANETs pose unique
	new research challenges, preventing the use of existing network security
	mechanisms. Industry has proposed security mechanisms to safeguard
	VANET operations. In this talk, we will discuss the properties and
	limitations of these mechanisms and present remaining research challenges.
	We will then present promising proposed research mechanisms to secure
	VANETs beyond current industry standards, such as the application
	of advanced cryptographic techniques to provide anonymity, the use
	of trusted computing technologies such as the Trusted Computing Group's
	(TCG's) Trusted Platform Module (TPM), or the use of location verification.
	We conclude the talk with remaining open research challenges, as
	well as opportunities and directions for addressing these challenges.},

  abstract = {Today's programming methodology emphasizes the study of static aspects
	of programs. In practice, however, monitoring a program in execution,
	i.e., monitoring a process, is routinely done by any programmer whose
	task it is to produce a reliable piece of software. There are two
	reasons why one might want to examine the dynamic aspects of a program:
	first, to evaluate the performance of a program, and hence to assess
	its overall behavior; and second, to demonstrate the presence of
	programming errors, isolate erroneous program code, and correct it.
	This latter task is commonly called ``debugging a program'' and requires
	a detailed insight into the innards of a program being executed.
	Today, many computer systems are being used to measure and control
	real-world processes. The pace of execution of these systems and
	their control programs is therefore bound to timing constraints imposed
	by the real-world process. As a step towards solving the problems
	associated with execution monitoring of real-time programs, we develop
	a set of appropriate concepts and define the basic requirements for
	a real-time monitoring facility. As a test case for the theoretical
	treatment of the topic, we design hardware and software for an experimental
	real-time monitoring system and describe its implementation.},

	for a time-triggered or an event-triggered architecture. Actually
	this decision deals with a non-functional property of a real-time
	system and should therefore be postponed as far as possible. Unfortunately,
	this property also exhibits functional qualities during the development

	monitors a distributed program's execution to check for violations

	in PT-DTL, a variant of past time linear temporal logic that we define.
	PT-DTL is suitable for expressing temporal properties of distributed
	systems. Specifically, the formulae of PT-DTL are relative to a particular
	process and are interpreted over a projection of the trace of global
	states that represents what that process is aware of. A formula relative
	to one process may refer to other processes' local states through
	remote expressions and remote formulae. In order to correctly evaluate
	remote expressions, we introduce the notion of Knowledge Vector and
	provide an algorithm which keeps a process aware of other processes'
	local states that can affect the validity of a monitored PT-DTL formula.
	Both the logic and the monitoring algorithm are illustrated through
	a number of examples. Finally, we describe our implementation of
	the algorithm in a tool called DIANA.},

	the selection of the oracle data. Experiments over four industrial

	These assertions can be used together with a combined on-line/off-line
	diagnostic system to provide a symbolic diagnosis, as a propositional

	Our framework guarantees monotonicity (more knowledge about properties
	implies more knowledge about faults) and allows to explicitly talk
	about diagnosability, implicit assumptions on behaviors or faults,

	the verification of a condition for a software model of a railroad

  abstract = {There is currently a broad effort underway in the United States and
	internationally by several organizations to craft regulations enabling
	the safe operation of UAVs in the NAS. Current federal regulations
	governing unmanned aircraft are limited in scope, and the lack of
	regulations is a barrier to achieving the full potential benefit
	of UAV operations. To inform future FAA regulations, an investigation
	of the safety considerations for UAV operation in the NAS was performed.
	Key issues relevant to operations in the NAS, including performance
	and operating architecture were examined, as well as current rules
	and regulations governing unmanned aircraft. In integrating UAV operations
	in the NAS, it will be important to consider the implications of
	different levels of vehicle control and autonomous capability and
	the source of traffic surveillance in the system. A system safety
	analysis was performed according to FAA system safety guidelines
	for two critical hazards in UAV operation: midair collision and ground
	impact. Event-based models were developed describing the likelihood
	of ground fatalities and midair collisions under several assumptions.
	From the models, a risk analysis was performed calculating the expected
	level of safety for each hazard without mitigation. The variation
	of expected level of safety was determined based on vehicle characteristics
	and population density for the ground impact hazard, and traffic
	density for midair collisions. The results of the safety analysis
	indicate that it may be possible to operate small UAVs with few operational
	and size restrictions over the majority of the United States. As
	UAV mass increases, mitigation measures must be utilized to further
	reduce both ground impact and midair collision risks to target levels
	from FAA guidance. It is in the public interest to achieve the full
	benefits of UAV operations, while still preserving safety through
	effective mitigation of risks with the least possible restrictions.
	Therefore, a framework was presented under which several potential
	mitigation measures were introduced and could be evaluated. It is
	likely that UAVs will be significant users of the future NAS, and
	this report provides an analytical basis for evaluating future regulatory
	decisions.},

	development tasks. Current monitoring efforts generally require extensive
	instrumentation of the software or dedicated hardware test rig designed
	to provide visibility into the software. To fully understand software's
	behavior, the production software must be studied in its production
	environment. To address this fundamental software engineering challenges,
	we propose a compiler and hardware supported framework for monitoring
	and observation of software-intensive systems. We place three fundamental
	requirements on our monitoring framework. The monitoring must be
	non-intrusive, low-overhead, and predictable so that the software
	is not unduly disturbed. The framework must also allow low-level
	monitoring and be highly flexible so we can accommodate a broad range
	of crucial monitoring activities. The general idea behind our work
	is that to make dramatic progress in non-intrusive, predictable,
	and fine-grained monitoring, we must change how software is compiled
	and how hardware is designed; a software-monitoring framework covering
	the development of monitors, through compilation, and down to the
	hardware is essential. To achieve our goals, we have pursued an approach
	leveraging the rapid emergence of multi-core processor architectures
	to achieve a non-intrusive, predictable, fine-grained, and highly
	flexible general purpose monitoring framework. In this report we
	describe our initial steps in this direction and provide some preliminary
	performance results achieved with this new multi-core architecture.
	We use separate cores for the execution of the application to be
	monitored and the monitors. We augment each core with identical programmable
	extraction logic that can observe an application executing on the
	core as its program state changes.},
