\section{Conclusion}
The increase in use of third-party, black-box components in safety-critical systems increases the difficulty of verifying the safety and correctness of these systems. Runtime verification is a useful tool during testing and verification of these systems, but performing runtime monitoring of primarily black-box system's requires monitors which do not require instrumentation or source code access.

We have presented an external bus-monitor architecture for safety-critical systems made up of potentially black-box components. 
We have presented a real-time embedded monitoring algorithm for safety-critical embedded systems with black-box COTS components. The monitor utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to check system state observed from a network bus against bounded MTL specifications.
Our algorithm \monitor performs eager checking of future-time formulas, providing the opportunity for early detection of violations which can means more time for system recovery.
%
A real-time embedded implementation of this monitor targeting CAN buses has been evaluated against a bench CAN network using replayed logs from a research autonomous vehicle, showing the feasibility of monitoring realistic specifications in real time from these types of network.
