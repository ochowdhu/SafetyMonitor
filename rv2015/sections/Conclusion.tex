\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We have developed a runtime monitoring approach for an ARV system.
Instead of instrumention, we passively monitor the system,
generating the system trace from the observed network state.
We have developed an efficient runtime monitoring algorithm, \monitor,
that eagerly checks for violations of properties written in future-bounded
propositional MTL. We have shown the efficiency of \monitor by implementing it
and evaluating it against logs obtained from system testing of the ARV.
\monitor was able to detect violations of several safety requirements in real-time.
Future work includes exploring monitors running in multi-core environment
to provide increased monitoring power as well as further
formalizing the interface mapping (possibly with a domain specific language).
